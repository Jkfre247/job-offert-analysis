Job Summary

About the job

The Department for International Trade (DIT) negotiates trade agreements for the UK and promotes UK Trade and Investment around the world.

The Global Supply Chains Directorate works across Government to strengthen critical supply chains. We assess vulnerabilities in critical supply chains and work with government departments to identify actions to improve resilience.

The Insights & Analysis is a multi-disciplinary analytical team that sits in the heart of the Global Supply Chains Directorate. The team is the main analytical function for the directorate, providing high quality and timely monitoring and analysis on supply chains. Key workstreams include undertaking detailed supply chain mapping exercises; rapid analysis in response to emerging disruptions; development of data-driven approaches to improve visibility of critical supply chains and their vulnerabilities; and development of new disruptive event monitoring systems to identify emerging risks to critical supply chains.

We have two Data Scientist roles available within the Insights & Analysis team. Both roles involve utilising government, public and commercial datasets to improve visibility and understanding of UK critical supply chains. Day to day, the postholders will be exploring and acquiring new datasets; manipulating large datasets and developing data-driven methods for identifying vulnerabilities and emerging risks; working with stakeholders across Government to understand requirements; generating proposals and ideas for new products; and developing interactive dashboards and tools to disseminate the team’s analysis across Government.

This is an exciting time to be joining the team as a Data Scientist, where you will have the opportunity to develop your skills in analysing and visualising newly acquired large firm-level supply chain datasets using cutting edge methods such as graph network analysis.

Job Description

You will be joining a truly multi-disciplinary analytical team of economists, statisticians, data scientists, operational researchers, social researchers and a supply chain specialist.

The post holder will champion the use of novel data sources and methods, working closely with stakeholders across the DIT, Government, and the private sector to develop new analytical tools for assessing vulnerabilities and disruptive events affecting critical supply chains and the UK economy.

The team’s analytical outputs are used across Government to decisions of some of the most biggest challenges facing the UK, therefore the postholder will be expected to drive forward their workstreams and deliver projects at pace. This will include developing innovative methods for disseminating complex data across the directorate and wider government. In doing so you will work in cross-government analytical working groups to share methodologies and insights, as well as developing close links to thinktanks, academics and international organisations.

Day-to-day activities include, but are not limited to:
Exploring and acquiring new open source, government held, and commercial data sources that improve data-driven visibility of UK critical supply chains, their vulnerabilities, and near real-time tracking of emerging risks and disruptive events.
Developing novel statistical and data science methodologies and frameworks for identifying supply chain vulnerabilities, linkages, and emerging risks to UK critical supply chains and imports.
Developing methodologies (e.g. Natural Language Processing) for synthesising qualitative data – such as overseas intelligence or news reports – to identify events affecting critical supply chains.
Automating report generation for policy and strategy colleagues, such as country supply chain reports.
Building relationships with policy customers across Government to identify requirements and scope new analytical products.
Building engaging visualisations, dashboards, and automatic reports to disseminate large complex volumes of data and analysis in an intuitive way that is accessible to non-analysts.
Making use of API’s and web-scraping methods to acquire new data sets.
Providing analytical support to other workstreams across the team, including supply chain mapping exercises and rapid analysis.

GiveDirectly (GD) aims to reshape international giving – and millions of lives – by providing cash grants directly to the poorest people in the world. The Brookings Institution estimates that $100B of cash transfers would be required to eliminate the poverty gap; the aid sector currently spends $135B each year, much of it on evidence-free interventions. GiveDirectly wants to change that, establishing cash transfers as a benchmark for foreign aid – as the index fund is a benchmark for the financial industry – and in the process accelerating the end of extreme poverty.

GD has raised over $800M since launching in 2011, delivered cash to more than 1 million people, and launched offices in 11 countries across North America, Africa, and the Middle East. We’ve also supported 19 large-scale, experimental research projects that indicate strong recipient impact of our programs – including the largest universal basic income experiment in history. We use concrete evidence to inform the design of our programs: from research results published in leading journals, to in-depth qualitative work. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company, while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD’s leading role within it) have been featured in the New York Times Magazine, This American Life, Foreign Affairs, and The Economist.

We’re looking for exceptional talent to grow our collaborative, diverse team. Joining GiveDirectly provides the opportunity to work alongside individuals who come from 21 different countries and speak 69 different languages. We’re actively working toward an equitable and inclusive environment for all team members, and seek candidates who will bring diverse perspectives and experiences to our organization. We recruit from organizations across all industries: our team has hailed from sectors including start-ups, government, consultancies, investment banks, and nonprofits.

Across our global offices, our culture is candid, analytical, non-hierarchical, and fast-paced. We value ability, adaptability, and willingness to learn. We offer competitive salary and benefits, as well as performance-based bonuses.

This role is fully remote but working hours must overlap with typical working hours (9am-5pm) in the East Africa timezone by at least 4 hours a few times per week.

About The Field Data Team

As we scale to reach millions of people experiencing extreme poverty, we believe that data can transform cash delivery by:
Improving recipient experience
Increasing operational efficiency
Mitigating risk
Conveying our impact to donors
To realize this vision, we are building a best-in-class data team focused on cash delivery: operations, payments, and recipient safeguarding.

You will be the Field Data team’s first Data Scientist, reporting to the Senior Data Manager and working closely with the Senior Data Architect. This is an opportunity to join at the inception of the team and guide foundational decisions regarding vision, priorities, and best practices. We are a small (but growing) group with a startup mentality, applying engineering best practices and a product development approach to data.

Our data infrastructure is built on AWS and Databricks, with dashboards and visualizations in Tableau. We primarily use SQL, Python, and R.

About This Role

You will deliver insights and decision making tools that help shape cash delivery by determining which projects we take on, how we design them, and how we implement them.

Responsibilities Include
Statistical analysis and predictive modeling. Own process end-to-end: implement statistical methods and build, train, and deploy predictive models to solve problems in cash delivery utilizing code (e.g., Python, R). Current priorities:
Targeting. Implement and improve existing machine learning algorithms predicting poverty level from call-detail records (CDR) and geospatial data. This work enables us to remotely identify eligible recipients at scale, and has been highlighted in WIRED with findings published by our research partners in Nature.
Risk prediction. Develop new risk prediction models that help us design programs and target recipient outreach to keep recipients and communities safe.
Support data quality assurance. Work with the Senior Data Architect to design processes that ensure key metrics, models, and analysis are built on high quality data.
Communication. Collaborate with leaders throughout the organization to define data product requirements, educate them about solutions, and make recommendations.
This role has a high degree of autonomy and the ability to shape our process from the ground up by determining best practices and informing the data product roadmap.

We’ll provide a diverse, energising and informal environment that focuses on equal opportunity and supports career progression. Roles in the team offer the opportunity to work flexibly where this does not conflict with business needs. We take personal and professional development very seriously and will enable you to make a positive difference to the team and to the wider Group.

Your Career

You will use your domain knowledge and technical skills to truly understand and solve the challenges faced by our clients, who are all world leading companies in science and technology.

You will need to build excellent relationships to collaborate with colleagues and enthusiastically engage with clients. We will provide a dedicated support network around you to ensure the best start to your career. Project team sizes are typically small and durations are relatively short, so you will make a big impact and quickly gain experience across different domains, allowing you to apply innovative thinking and transferable skills to solve fresh challenges.

Your Future

The key to our success is the quality of our staff. We value your academic background as much as technical skills, so we do not expect you to be a software expert. If you have a good grounding in Python and a keen interest to learn, we will invest in you to develop professional skills in new technologies and languages. We will provide extensive training throughout your career and many courses often lead to recognised qualifications.

Working on our projects is hugely rewarding and you will never stop learning and developing. With support from your manager, you will shape your own career, and we will help you develop the skills you need to achieve your ambitions. Career paths can be focused on technology, domain expertise or people management, or a combination of these.

About You

We are looking for a creative problem solver with an excellent academic record in science, mathematics or engineering. Though not essential, we value PhDs and we recognise and reward the additional skills they bring. You should have excellent interpersonal skills and be comfortable explaining complex concepts to clients and colleagues from all backgrounds.

You should understand and enjoy programming in Python and be able to write a few lines of code. You should also know how various data science techniques, from statistics to machine learning, are used to interpret complex data.

Our Culture

We are proud of our amazing culture, where a positive attitude and a commitment to continuous learning are valued. The wellbeing and engagement of all staff is our priority, and we work in a collaborative and supportive environment with a good work-life balance. As well as a competitive starting salary, we offer a range of benefits, which you can select to fit your needs.

We encourage flexible working and we trust staff to balance the needs of their projects with their personal commitments. Sometimes you will be required to work on client sites, which are usually within easy reach of your base location. Sometimes you will dial in to remote meetings with a geographically dispersed team. At other times there is no substitute for meeting up with colleagues to work together and share ideas.

We are dedicated to creating a diverse environment and are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We appreciate individuals for who they are and value the diversity they bring to the workplace.

The information that you have provided in your cover letter and CV will be used to assess your application.

Why Consumer Healthcare?

Right now, we’re on an incredible journey as we prepare to become the first independent, 100% focused consumer healthcare company. We’re doing this at a time when the work we do has never mattered more. Better everyday health is about improving the health and wellness of the consumers that we touch every year – over a billion and a half of them – and it goes beyond products. It’s about truly helping people manage their health proactively in different ways as consumer needs evolve.

With category leading brands such as Sensodyne, Voltaren and Centrum, built on trusted science and human understanding, and combined with our passion, knowledge and expertise, we’re uniquely placed to do this and to grow a strong, successful business.

This is an exciting time to join us and help shape the future. It’s an opportunity to be part of something special.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

In Consumer Healthcare we embrace our diverse workforce by creating an inclusive environment that celebrates our unique perspectives, generates curiosity to create unmatched understanding of each other, and promotes fair and equitable outcomes for everyone.

We’re striving to create a climate where we celebrate our diversity in all forms by treating each other with respect, listening to different viewpoints, supporting our communities, and creating a workplace where your authentic self belongs and thrives

Location

Recently we’ve shared some exciting proposals with our colleagues which mark an important moment in our preparations for separation and becoming a new, standalone Consumer Healthcare company.

Our preparations are going well. GSK is on track to separate in mid-2022 and create two incredible new companies, each with the ability to improve the health of millions of patients and consumers worldwide, and both great places to work.

We’ve already confirmed that our new Consumer Healthcare company will be headquartered in the UK and the first step we’re taking is to announce proposals to move our CH business from our current location in GSK House in Brentford when we separate, into a new, CH headquarters in Weybridge. This will be a temporary, but important move in the short term, whilst we take this opportunity to design for the future and create an inspiring, flexible, collaborative workspace that meets the changing needs of our people and our business needs.

Inspired by our new culture and purpose, and with a commitment to our sustainability goals, we plan to build a new campus close by which would be home to our headquarters teams, our UK business, our global Oral Health category, R&D and innovation teams, as well as a state-of-the-art Shopper Science lab.

The current and future success of the New GSK and New CH business is due in large part to the talent that resides in each organization. To ensure stability in the lead up to Separation, individuals who are currently dedicated to either business (New GSK or New CH) will not be able to apply for roles in the other business (including employees in the Global Support Functions and the Corporate Functions) prior to Separation, unless where their role has been placed at risk of redundancy. An exception process is in place, however cases in which exceptions would be made are expected to be rare (e.g. where a new role represents a significant promotion opportunity). You must therefore discuss this with your line manager before submitting an application.

#TechConsumer

As a company driven by our values of Patient focus, Transparency, Respect and Integrity, we know inclusion and diversity are essential for us to be able to succeed. We want all our colleagues to thrive at GSK bringing their unique experiences, ensuring they feel good and to keep growing their careers. As a candidate for a role, we want you to feel the same way.

As an Equal Opportunity Employer, we are open to all talent. In the US, we also adhere to Affirmative Action principles.

We believe in an agile working culture for all our roles. If flexibility is important to you, we encourage you to explore with our hiring team what the opportunities are.

Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you’d like to discuss any adjustments to our process which might help you demonstrate your strengths and capabilities. You can either call us on 0808 234 4391, or send an email ukdiversity.recruitment@gsk.com

Sylvera is scaling carbon markets with software. We do this by applying advanced machine learning techniques to satellite data to quantify with unprecedented accuracy the amount of carbon stored in landscapes - and then we visualise that data to our customers.

We believe the transparency Sylvera provides will enable carbon markets to have a more positive impact on the world in a shorter space of time. This will be critical in keeping the planet under 2C of warming and provide huge wider benefits to nature and society.

Founded just 2 years ago, Sylvera has now scaled to over 140 employees across the world and has raised over $30m from leading VCs like Index Ventures and Insight Partners. We’ve also collaborated with leading institutions - University College London and UCLA.

We're on a super steep trajectory over the next couple of years - we want incredible people that are as passionate as we are about the mission and want to build an amazing organisation with us to achieve it.

What will I be doing? ‍‍👩‍💻👨‍💻

Voluntary carbon markets are in the early stages of hyper-growth, with analysts forecasting the market hitting $50Bn by 2030 (:$1Bn in 2021). Along this journey, the market will experience complex twists and turns, as the market contends with global/national policy making, innovation within carbon markets, and the broader whims of financial markets.

As the founding member of our internally focussed Data Science team, your job will be to improve our market insight, prioritisation, processes, and products using data.

The role itself will be an exceptionally hands-on data science role. Critically, you’ll work cross-functionally, making data and insights portable across the business. The opportunity to create business impact, and to impact our mission to power the worlds transition to net zero is huge. Examples of work includes:

Market modelling: Build sophisticated credit supply and demand models, and integrate them with pricing data
Power new research efforts: Working with our policy, marketing, engineering, product and commercial teams, you’ll use data to power market leading insights
Drive sales and ratings production prioritisation: Data on current and estimated market demand can help prioritise the data we produce
Product development: You’ll use your knowledge of our data sets to build out data driven MVP’s
External data provider coordination: To help us compound out unique data sets you’ll facilitate discussions with external data providers and vendors, thinking about business value as well as technical integration aspects

It will be for you to exercise your judgement on speed vs scalability i.e. as to when an ad hoc analysis, a service, a tool or dashboard is the appropriate solution , and when to graduate your tools to our product and engineering teams to turn a tool into an internal product.

We’re looking for someone with: 🧠💚

2-4 years experience as Data scientist
Innate curiosity, with the drive to understand data and visualise trends lurking beneath
Ability to delve into subject matters you know little about, and quickly get your head around them
Willingness to work with a mix of clean and dirty data, collaborative and proactive mindset to resolve data quality issues
Is comfortable working in a fast paced startup environment where the tradeoff for extremely high potential to have impact is ambiguity and the need to be proactive and drive outcomes
Strong written communication skills - comfortable summarising complex ideas in writing Familiarity with Python (Pandas, visualisation packages, etc.)
Worked extensively to pull data from Databases and APIs, utilising SQL & Regex
Solid statistical toolkit including linear, multivariate and logistic regression
Ability to work independently

To be clear, this is neither a data engineering role nor a Machine learning role. Please keep a look out if you are interested in that kind of opportunity.

Benefits 💰

Equity in a rapidly growing startup
No corners cut in having the best tech to do your job
Unlimited annual leave - and encouragement to actually use it!
Half Day Fridays - 2pm finish every Friday
Enhanced parental leave
Up to 20 days paid sick leave
£500 WFH allowance
Access to Mental Health support via Spill

About You

You’re on track to achieve a minimum 2.2 in any STEM or any Data Scientist relate degree. You must be in your penultimate year at university.

You’ll receive some great rewards and benefits including 25 days’ annual leave plus statutory holidays (pro-rata for 12-week placements), a buddy to support you during your placement, and a Graduate Development Programme opportunity.

About Us

As Great Britain’s electricity system operator (ESO), we sit at the heart of the electricity system, using our outstanding engineering and commercial expertise to balance electricity supply and demand. Ultimately, we keep the electricity flowing directly to where it’s needed, second by second.

As you may have seen the Government and Ofgem have asked the ESO to take on new roles and responsibilities to help deliver net-zero.

Becoming the Energy Future System Operator is a critical step to help deliver a reliable and clean energy transition for all. The ESO, including all of its existing roles, will be at the heart of the new Future System Operator, taking on additional roles with a whole energy system mindset to drive progress towards net zero while maintaining energy security and minimising costs for consumers.

The new organisation will be set up as a public corporation with operational independence from government – bringing parties together to support optimised decision making and action. As now, it will be licenced and regulated by Ofgem but funded by consumers through price control agreements. It is anticipated that the new organisation will be up and running by or in 2024.

Our values and principles

At National Grid ESO, through listening to what our customers need, every day we do the right thing and find a better way.

As a National Grid ESO employee, you’ll treat our customers as a priority, taking time to listen and work with them to help give them the best experience we possibly can.

You’ll provide accessible information when our customers need it and make things simple by using your expertise to guide them. Above all, you’ll follow through on your promises to deliver value, drive efficiency and give them a great customer experience.

We offer inclusion and diversity training for everyone here at National Grid ESO, with a view to building an inclusive working environment and developing all our employees.

Your ultimate goal will always be to bring greater insights to humanitarian crises, leading to better outcomes for the people affected. In practice this could be anything from identifying and preparing appropriate datasets, writing code, evaluating data quality, conducting statistical analysis, creating visualisations and data models and much more.

MapAction’s Data Science volunteer roles don’t currently include field volunteering but as our strategy and your experience will inevitably evolve, it would be useful to understand if you would ever be keen to deploy.

Come and be part of something that is exciting and impactful!

Why MapAction?

MapAction is a leading humanitarian mapping charity delivering information services and products to enhance decision making in disasters and conflicts. In collaboration with our partners, this mapped information helps responders understand vulnerabilities and target their response effectively, contributing to saving lives and minimising suffering. We work through a team of skilled volunteer professionals and a small paid staff team.

We have built a strong reputation in the humanitarian sector and are a technical partner of the United Nations, Non-Government Organisations and Civil Society Organisations, the Red Cross, Red Crescent Movement, regional entities and national authorities.

The humanitarian sector is evolving, and technical expertise such as data science, GIS, mapping, information management, data processing and visualisation are becoming increasingly utilised for improving decision making in complex humanitarian response.

About Deep Science Ventures

Deep Science Ventures (DSV) is a venture creator combining available scientific knowledge and founder-type scientists into high-impact ventures to build a future where both humans and the planet thrive. DSV operates in 4 sectors: Agriculture, Climate, Pharmaceuticals and Computation, tackling the challenges defining those areas by taking a first-principles approach and partnering with leading institutions.

About The Role

In 2023, DSV is launching Deep Science Ventures College to exponentially increase the number of people solving the world’s hardest problems through our first accredited training program, the Venture Science Doctorate. We will be building on DSV's proven process of identifying and addressing reasons for failures in key science-driven areas from climate change mitigation and cancer to heterogeneous compute. To date, this has been a long and manual process which limits how rapidly we can address these challenges and how fast any science-driven company can move. With the recent advancements in transformers, semantic search and learning analytics, we see a path to massively accelerate and scale this work to give not only our team but all researchers superhuman powers and, in time, to reduce the cost of science to near zero. We have demonstrated the key principles in-house and are looking to build a team to optimise and productise this work and help us scale to take on hundreds of thousands of challenges.

Key Responsibilities

Design, train and deploy custom transformer-based large language models to accelerate the speed of scientific discovery based on our existing tried and tested venture design approaches.
Design and evaluate model performance and accuracy metrics relevant to speed and quality of scientific discovery and product development.
Lead data strategy integration across internal sources (including text, video and audio data) and external sources and products.
Building systems to continually fine-tune leveraging human experience to continually improve the effectivness of the model.
Auto-generate into external communication material

Requirements

Machine learning practitioner who thrives on the question of how to make users superhuman by continually optimising models.
Has worked in fast moving start-up environments from early 10s of users to hundreds of thousands of users.
Up to speed with state-of-the-art in transformers and particularly Large Language Models with strong opinions and ideally practical experience in embedding, LLM-based reasoning/classification, vector databases, semantic search, retrieval strategies and making LLM interfaces fast enough for scale.
Experience with fine-tuning and model optimisations (for performance and inference speed/cost).
Comfortable leveraging managed services for fast prototyping.
Ability to learn – you learn new concepts and skills rapidly and look to understand things in an in-depth way
Confident in designing analytics pipelines to track and optimise user performance and the impact of changes to the model

Good to have

Experience with deploying human-in-the-loop RL or other ‘instruction-tuned’ approaches.
Experienced in MLOps for later scaling

Benefits

Competitive salary;
Flexible working environment (remote or hybrid);
Rapid personal development and massive learning curve;
Working with some of the most ambitious and impact-driven individuals you'll ever find;
Help build the next generation of hard tech ventures.

This highly successful strategy consultancy specialise in the government and defence sectors.

They have significant innovation funding from the MoD, meaning that they don’t just pitch an idea to improve what’s in place but actually have to prove that something has never been done before and is genuinely different to anything or anyone else.

The Role

Your role would be to develop and design decision aid tools and models to carry out analysis for customers and more recently, there has been an increased focus on product development. The content of decision aids, used for strategic or operational decision making, is predominantly AI based machine learning and there are a range of unique techniques developed internally.

A niche but exciting area they work in is explainable AI, which is a part of past, current projects and future plans. Given that clients are typically within the defence sector, when machine learning algorithms spit out an answer, it’s not possible to simply rely on the computer saying this is what you should do. It’s essential to add reasons why, which is challenging to generate from standard ML algorithms.

The Individual

Three years’ or more of experience in data science.
Strong Python proficiency.
Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written.
To acquire security clearance, it’s a necessity that you have lived in the UK for five consecutive years without spending more than three consecutive months out of the UK.

We’re building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we’re looking for brilliant builders who want to help define a low carbon future.

Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.

You can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process.

Working at CarbonChain

To join CarbonChain, you’ll be a keen team player who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we’ve run Amazon’s European supply chain, built JustEat’s corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We’ve got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there’s a lot we don’t know, and we’re hoping you can help fill that gap.

We encourage every member of our team to be the best they can be, whether that’s developing skills through their learning budget or participating in reading groups. Our work requires everybody to straddle the physical and digital worlds, and a growth mindset is essential.

What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?

As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there’s a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding, and get insights to clients.

As the first Data Science hire in the NYC office, you’ll help form the team in NYC and collaborate closely with London. Your work will directly contribute to the acquisition and success of North American clients, whilst helping to shape the product to meet the needs of a new market.

This is a role that will involve lots of contact with clients and close collaboration with the sales team. We’re looking for a commercially-minded data scientist who is curious about discovering and solving customer problems.

You Can Expect To Have
Ownership of your projects
Extensive client exposure
The ability to make real changes with tangible business value
Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We’ve got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.

Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology and the ability to build close relationships with your team.

Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?
Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond
Machine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch
Data visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and Altair
Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.
Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.
PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you’ll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.
Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).
Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.
Quality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team.
Agile development, using various approaches from Scrum toElephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements.
GitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality.
Continuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.
Teamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business.
You don’t need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we’d love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.

What We Require From Applicants
Right to work in the US and willingness to come to the NYC office 2+ days a week
2+ years of relevant work experience
A passion for environmental issues
A demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with engineers
The grit and energy to work in an early stage startup
What We're Offering
Healthcare
Competitive salary + generous equity package
Flexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing
$2,000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things
Tech equipment of your choice
Regular social activities
Generous amount of holidays, 26 days of annual leave
We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.

Role: Data Scientist CRM & Customer Analytics

Location: Office in Central London typically twice a week but do offer flexibility

Remuneration: £60-70k base + benefits

Are you a full stack data scientist?

Not just skilled in the modelling and analytics side, but whos also able to turn their hand to a bit of data engineering too from time to time.

Someone whos interested in taking on a role with a clear pathway to management. Leading a section of this data consultancys resource, working with big clients and international projects.

Youll be joining data consultancy, one who specialises in working with customer and marketing data to drive actionable insights and help businesses optimise marketing, CRM and media spend. Delivering meaningful uplifts on marketing spend, improving customer experiences through relevance, personalisation and engagement.

Projects youll be working on will typically align to marketing and CRM projects looking at both on and offline data, coding using SQL and Python.

There will be a bit of exposure working with Adobe Analytics too, pulling digital data and translating it into marketing behavioural insight.

Youll have a lot of variety of projects to get your teeth into and will likely include a mix of:
Customer analytics and segmentations
Channel optimisation
Dashboarding and reporting
Digital insight generation
Customer journey mapping
Data engineering and architecture
You will be working direct with clients across multiple industries, including automotive giants and tech firms. Capturing their requirements, deciding the appropriate methodologies and approach to get the right outcomes, shape the data and carry out modelling, presenting output to clients and implementing recommendations into appropriate action.

Your involvement with clients will begin with the business challenge. So a degree of business acumen is important. Understanding how to identify and unlock the right solution through a mix of commercial and technical capabilities.

Often speaking with the client to get under the skin of their challenges. Then talking about how using their data in inventive and creative ways can help unblock the issue, show them how to tackle the problem or even create the solution for them.

One of the big things this business is also offering is flexibility. Whilst they do talk about going to office a couple of times a week, theyre not wedded to that need. Its really down to what best suits the individual whilst also supporting their own learning and development needs.

So if thats also important to you, this could not just be a great development opportunity for you. But could also help meet those work/life balance ambitions too.

Experience Needed
Competent coding skills with SQL and Python
Good blend of technical skills matched with business acumen ensuring youre working with customer and business solutions in mind.
Previous experience within a customer/loyalty type analytics and data science environment would be beneficial
Good knowledge of various modelling techniques

Level: Mid-Senior

Hybrid - 2-3 days in London (Southwark)

Salary - £65,000 - £85,000

Who are we?

Carbon Re is an AI research and development company dedicated to reducing gigatonnes of humanity’s carbon emissions each year. We are focused on the energy intensive manufacturing industries; cement, steel, glass, etc. which are responsible for approximately 20% of global emissions and are referred to as ‘hard-to-abate industries’ for which there is currently no viable path to decarbonisation. Our mission is to develop Machine Learning products and solutions that can enable rapid decarbonisation of these industries. Initially this will involve improving and optimising the current manufacturing process but in the long term we aim to rethink and redesign these manufacturing systems for net-zero and accelerate the development of new climate-friendly materials and processes.

We are delighted to have recently raised £4.2m in seed funding led by Planet A Ventures to help us scale up the deployment of our platform, develop new products and continue hiring the best talent in the world.

What are we hiring for?

We are looking for a Software Engineer to join our Machine Learning team, focused on improving the internal models that power our recommendation engines for industrial plants.

You will work with time-series physical and chemical data to build deep learning models. Your goal will be to develop better and more performant models, and to improve our internal understanding of our growing datasets.

Given the innovative and pioneering nature of our work, you will need to be an independent and creative problem solver capable of working under uncertainty on areas of critical importance to the company.

We are also looking for someone with a genuine passion for our mission and a keen interest in researching how we can best optimise these complex industrial processes.

You will primarily work in our shared codebase, using PyTorch as your daily driver. You will also contribute to our fear-free development process by writing tooling to help the team move faster and more sustainably. You will be supported by continuous builds, tests, a constructive review system, and a culture of continual improvement.

About You

Requirements

You Will Thrive In This Role If You

Have a strong understanding of Machine Learning, from foundations to modern approaches.
Have experience (and/or strong interest) in building models that understand and reason about complex physical and chemical processes.
Have experience with developing machine learning models and recommendation systems for time-series data.
Enjoy running experiments in a rigorous way.
Are strongly interested in making an impact towards quickly mitigating climate change.

If you also have experience of Python and at least one of PyTorch, JAX or Tensorflow, this would be very beneficial.

If you don’t have all of the requirements but have a passion for our mission, then please still consider applying. We are building a diverse company and are keen to consider people from a wide range of backgrounds.

Benefits

Our culture:

We don’t draw a specific line between engineering and research teams. We all share the same tech stack, knowledge, tools, and work. We do fundamental machine learning research, and we build and ship commercial-quality software, so with time you will be likely to equally learn and care about many different aspects of our stack. We aim to create software that helps us achieve our mission in a sustainable and principled way, and to share our findings in the open through publications and open-source development.

We are acting now. Due to the cumulative radiative forcing effect, one tonne of carbon saved today will help us meet global temperature targets as much as two tonnes saved in 2050. The cumulative impact of immediate operational improvements on carbon-producing processes will deliver greater reduction in global heating than many longer-term capital intensive solutions. Simply put: we need to prioritise cuts today and our solutions help to achieve this.

We value diversity, equity, and inclusivity. With a diverse range of nationalities and a range of backgrounds represented in our small team, we aim to build an inclusive environment where our people can bring their authentic selves to work, be respected for who they are and the exceptional work they do. We welcome and actively encourage applications from all sections of society and are committed to offering equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, disability, age, citizenship, or any other basis. We see our diversity as an asset as we tackle challenging problems through technology.

Benefits

As a young start-up, our benefits package will change and improve quickly as we grow. Our current benefits include:

A generous EMI stock options scheme
Pension
25 days holiday + 3 Company set grace days (usually falling Christmas/NY) + bank holidays

We are exploring a range of new benefits which we expect to roll out imminently.

Our Interview Process

Initial screening call (30-40 minutes)
Machine Learning Theory chat (45-55 minutes)
Face to face interview (2 hours) consisting of a pair programming exercise in Python (60 mins) followed by a discussion of a domain-specific research paper (60 mins). This is designed to give you a real world experience of the way we work and the problems we solve.

You will get an opportunity to see the offices, meet some of the team and get a feel for our culture.

SHARE is a creative agency powered by data. Our teams are fascinated by human behaviour, and particularly how this impacts their online activity. We utilise whatever data we can get our hands on to drive the content that we produce, creating smart strategies, and more meaningful experiences. We’re looking for a newbie to join our award winning Data Science team at an entry level position - ideal for someone wanting to take the first steps on their data science career journey!
In a little more detail:
As a member of SHARE’s Data Science team, you will utilise a strong analytical mindset and solid programming skills to provide insight to our internal strategy and creative teams and directly to our wide range of clients.
The Junior Data Scientist will be required to implement our own intelligence suite of deep learning, NLP, and forecasting tools and analyse and communicate the resulting insights in a way that addresses our clients’ challenges, and ultimately, their success. Recently, we’ve been focussing on the NLP side of things as our clients have huge databases of high quality social media, survey and review documents that we’ve been applying linguistic and psychological theory to squeeze business impact from.
You will be involved across the entire data science workflow - from finding and importing datasets, cleaning and tidying the data, data transformation and feature engineering and of course, modelling and visualisation.

We programme mainly in R (with some other languages thrown in), so the role is ideal for a recent graduate seeking to get into data science or an analyst with some knowledge of R striving to develop their data science skills. The role will require a mix of skills, with some computer science knowledge for the development of function writing and package deployment in the machine learning and NLP workspace, but also social science and research skills to present results in a way that answer business and research questions.
You’ll be reporting to our Data Director, but will also work closely with a variety of internal teams, including Strategy, Design/Creative, Project Management, and Operations.
Key Responsibilities
Support the Data Director with the development, documentation and deployment of our data science offering.
Develop an understanding of the connection between our analytic techniques, social media strategy, and operational processes – how do we make statistics easy to digest for business stakeholders and marketeers?
Collaborate with internal teams to ensure our data science work is informing and shaping our clients’ strategy
Utilise data sources beyond social to help our teams create industry leading digital content, and help us to prove the value of social
Essential Experience, Skills & Behaviours:
A solid understanding of the R programming language; particularly the ‘tidyverse’ packages such as dplyr and ggplot2
Package management and understand of git / github
A keen interest in language data and models such as BERT AND GPT3
Advanced proficiency in Excel and Powerpoint
Strong attention to detail
A keen interest in major social platforms and the digital landscape
Excellent communication, strong writing skills, and a confident presentation style
A passion for problem solving, and the ability to translate data into well-reasoned, relevant, and actionable insight
Adaptable, calm and productive under pressure, with the ability to prioritise workload
Insatiable curiosity
A team player
Flourish in a fast-paced, start-up environment
Fluency in English; additional languages considered favourably
Willingness to learn! We get it, this isn’t a job post that’s asking for 8 years hands-on python for an entry level position. We want to provide you with the foundation to develop, all we ask is you show the desire to keep learning.
Bonus points:
Previous work or experience with Natural Language Processing techniques
Some experience with web data services like APIs
Hatred of SPSS. Our Data Director built the core of our R Package Suite because he despised using SPSS for statistics at university. If you share that pain you’ll fit right in.
Previous use of major social analytics tools (Sprinklr, Facebook, Twitter, social listening, etc.)
Knowledge of wider programming languages such as Python, JavaScript and C#
Knowledge of cloud computing services such as Azure or AWS.
A good eye for design
An outgoing personality
A ping pong whizz
Keen to work in a fun, innovative environment

How to apply:
Please send an up-to-date CV to talktous@sharecreative.com and provide a little insight into why you think you’d be a perfect fit for the role.
Unfortunately, any applications without an attached CV won’t be considered. This is your chance to dazzle us, and what you have to say makes a big difference. Good luck!
