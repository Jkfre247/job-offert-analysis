At Plume, we believe that technology isn't about moving faster, it's about making life’s moments better. Which is why we’ve built the world's first, and only, open and hardware-independent service delivery platform for smart homes, small businesses, enterprises, and beyond. Our SaaS platform uses WiFi, advanced AI, and machine learning to create the future of connected spaces—and human experiences—at massive scale.

We now deliver services to over 40 million locations globally and have managed over 2 billion devices on our platform. We’re expanding rapidly, pioneering a new category, and we achieved our Series F funding in just four years. Our customers include many of the world's largest Communications Service Providers (CSPs) who look to Plume to help them evolve their smart home offerings while gleaning insights from their own data.

With a bias for action and a love for being trailblazers, the team at Plume embodies a combination of relentless curiosity and imaginative innovation. We challenge ourselves to think in ways that other companies don't, work to do what should be done (rather than what can), and if we can’t do it exceptionally well, we don’t do it. It’s how we've assembled a team of world-class builders, thinkers, and doers. And it’s how we’re reinventing what’s possible every day.

Plume's Data Services team is looking for Machine Learning Engineers with a desire to innovate in building ML models on the edge. You will work cross-functionally with product, data science, software, and firmware development teams to tackle challenges around building and deploying ML algorithms. Due to the unique datasets and requirements that Plume has, you will be solving challenging problems on a daily basis using cutting edge technologies and advanced architectural patterns involving both distributed systems and edge devices. This is a high impact role with immense growth opportunities and will truly put your software and machine learning engineering skills to the test.

What You’ll Do
Lead the development of machine learning algorithms on health/fitness data
Improve existing machine learning pipeline scalability, usability, and performance
Work closely with cross-functional teams to tackle challenges around time series data coming from sensors and edge devices
Connect the gap between R&D and production and collaborate with our product managers, data scientists, and firmware engineers to ensure the delivery of high quality and robust solutions for our users

BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related technical field
3+ years of industry experience in developing ML systems
Strong programming skills in Python
Proficiency manipulating big data with Apache Spark (PySpark)

About Plume

As the creator of the only open, hardware-independent, cloud-controlled experience platform for CSPs and their subscribers, Plume partners with over 250 CSP customers, including some of the world’s largest such as Comcast, Charter, Liberty Global, and J:COM.

Using OpenSync, the most widely supported open-source, silicon-to-cloud framework for smart spaces, Plume’s software-defined network allows CSPs to decouple their service offerings from hardware and rapidly curate and deliver new services over a multi-vendor, open-platform architecture.

Backed by investors such as Insight Partners and SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Plume is now valued at $2.6B, having added over $500M in funding in 2021 alone.

Plume is an equal opportunity workplace that maintains a continuing policy of nondiscrimination in all employment practices and decisions, ensuring equal employment opportunities for all qualified individuals without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, national origin, age, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, pregnancy, childbirth or related individual conditions, medical conditions (as defined by state law), military or veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local law."
