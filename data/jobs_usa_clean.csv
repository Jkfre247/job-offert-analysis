Making something “fun” is inherently subjective, and can’t come without disagreement. We value being open, honest, and approachable. Respect breeds communication and good communication means good games. If you aren’t approachable, in good times and bad, Airship isn’t for you.

Everyone’s got the message: machine learning is changing everything. And for Fortune 500 brands in every vertical, it’s actually true — ML predictions are solving billion-dollar, migraine problems. But for smaller brands, the talent and investment needed to build an ML platform are simply out of reach.

Black Crow is changing that--fast. Founded by a team that has spent the last decade in machine learning, our mission is to help DTC brands turbocharge their growth by delivering bespoke, Fortune 500-grade ML predictions. It works out of the box, delivered as a service, and costs less than one data scientist. Integration: one click.

12 months ago, we had one DTC brand using our predictions. Now we have over 150 — including Solo Stove, the RealReal, SAKARA, Native, Keurig, and Bearaby. There are 50,000 more who haven’t heard of us yet.

Black Crow AI recently concluded a $25 million Series A led by top investors in the DTC and B2B SaaS sectors, and is well funded for multiple years

The team + culture.

This is the 3rd company Black Crow’s founders have started together. Both previous companies scaled to >$100MM and were voted ‘Best Places to Work’ in NYC many times.

The founders are building Black Crow to be commercially successful, high growth, and valuable. But that’s insufficient as an end--we’re also building a company that we actually want to work at! That means we are human first--we don’t expect anyone to transform themselves to show up at work. It means working together is a positive force in our lives, not something we tolerate for the paycheck. And it means we see diversity as a strength.

Black Crow AI is seeking an innovative Data Scientist to join as a charter member of our team. We’re taking off and expanding our top notch product team. You’ll have big, exciting responsibilities including developing new game-changing machine learning applications alongside our engineering and product teams, conducting product discovery with potential customers to inform the future potential use cases of our platform.

We’re looking for someone with an entrepreneurial spirit, who isn’t afraid to get their hands dirty and dive in to both get things done, and make improvements.

What you'll do.

Develop algorithms and predictive models to solve critical business problems
Drive the collection of new data and the refinement of existing data sources
Analyze and interpret the results of product experiments
Manage work prioritization by asking the right questions
Identify new areas of innovation
Communicate brilliantly and develop strong relationships at all levels, internally and externally

About you.

Degree in math, statistics, engineering, or computer science
5+ years of relevant experience as a Data Scientist or similar position
Experience in feature extraction/development, feature engineering and using data mining tools

Experience in building machine learning/statistical models on large scale data with understanding of underlying ML Algorithms and ML life cycle
Strong knowledge of at least one programming language (Python, Java, Scala) and frameworks appropriate for large scale analysis of structured and unstructured data
Experience with Apache Spark and cloud services like AWS is a plus

Terner Housing Innovation Labs (Terner Labs) is a startup nonprofit organization that formulates and advances bold strategies to house families from all walks of life in vibrant, sustainable, and affordable homes and communities. As a sister organization of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley, we transform innovative research and policy expertise into actionable tools, programs, and partnerships with the public and private sector. We are committed to solutions that increase the supply and lower the cost of housing in ways that align with equity and environmental goals; expand access to quality homes and communities to support racial, social, and economic inclusion; and drive innovation in housing policy and practice.

The Housing Affordability Data Lab (Data Lab) program of Terner Labs creates data tools and metrics to inform government and community decision-making around housing and land use policy. The initial product of the Data Lab is Terner’s Housing Policy Dashboard (the Dashboard). The Dashboard is an analytical tool that overlays a real estate proforma on top of parcel-level land use and regulatory data. This allows policymakers to understand how specific housing policies or market inputs – such as changes in building limits, development costs, density bonuses, or market conditions – might impact real-world decisions that affect housing development amounts and patterns across a city or region, aiding policy makers who want to address the affordability crisis.

The Dashboard was initially built for Los Angeles and Terner Labs is now expanding to a cohort of 8-10 additional communities in the coming year. The team is planning for a wider expansion in subsequent years. Additionally, the Data Lab is developing other new data tools and metrics, offering an exciting opportunity for ground-floor development of new data products that advance housing affordability and equity.

HOW YOU’LL CONTRIBUTE
Terner Labs seeks an entrepreneurial and dynamic Data Scientist to join the Data Lab team.

The Data Scientist will report to the Data Lab Director and will play an essential role in the Data Labs’ expansion by enhancing the technical capabilities of our products and onboarding more cities onto our policy simulation platform. This is an opportune time to join and help shape the future of data-backed evidence in housing policy decisions.

RESPONSIBILITIES:

Enhance the simulation capabilities of the Dashboard by developing and implementing additions to the proforma methodology and refining various assumptions
Help build and expand the Terner Housing Policy Dashboard for other jurisdictions by collecting and cleaning data from partner cities, public records, industry data, state policy details, and other sources
Liaise with partner cities to refine city-level data sets and develop methods for modeling specific policies or economic conditions
Collaborate with an experienced team of technical contractors, partner organizations, graduate students, and Terner Labs and Center staff to implement performance and UX improvements
Assist and consult on various research projects and studies utilizing the Dashboard’s data and simulation capacities
Help launch and develop new Data Labs products and services

SKILL SETS / MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS
Demonstrated ability to use Python and/or R, as well as Excel, to manage and analyze large datasets
Strong understanding of data cleaning, data linkage, and imputation methods
Familiarity with land use, housing policy, or real estate data is a plus
Experience with proforma analysis is a strong plus
Familiarity with, or ability to quickly learn, elements of municipal zoning codes and land use policy
Flexible self-starter comfortable managing multiple deadlines and priorities
