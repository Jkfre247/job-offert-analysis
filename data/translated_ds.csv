The Dashboard was initially built for Los Angeles and Terner Labs is now expanding to a cohort of 8-10 additional communities in the coming year.

Developing novel statistical and data science methodologies and frameworks for identifying supply chain vulnerabilities, linkages, and emerging risks to UK critical supply chains and imports. Developing methodologies (e.g. Natural Language Processing) for synthesising qualitative data – such as overseas intelligence or news reports – to identify events affecting critical supply chains. Automating report generation for policy and strategy colleagues, such as country supply chain reports. Building relationships with policy customers across Government to identify requirements and scope new analytical products. Building engaging visualisations, dashboards, and automatic reports to disseminate large complex volumes of data and analysis in an intuitive way that is accessible to non-analysts.

The Brookings Institution estimates that $100B of cash transfers would be required to eliminate the poverty gap; the aid sector currently spends $135B each year, much of it on evidence-free interventions. GiveDirectly wants to change that, establishing cash transfers as a benchmark for foreign aid – as the index fund is a benchmark for the financial industry – and in the process accelerating the end of extreme poverty.  GD has raised over $800M since launching in 2011, delivered cash to more than 1 million people, and launched offices in 11 countries across North America, Africa, and the Middle East. We’ve also supported 19 large-scale, experimental research projects that indicate strong recipient impact of our programs – including the largest universal basic income experiment in history. We use concrete evidence to inform the design of our programs: from research results published in leading journals, to in-depth qualitative work. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company, while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD’s leading role within it) have been featured in the New York Times Magazine, This American Life, Foreign Affairs, and The Economist.  We’re looking for exceptional talent to grow our collaborative, diverse team. Joining GiveDirectly provides the opportunity to work alongside individuals who come from 21 different countries and speak 69 different languages.

The information that you have provided in your cover letter and CV will be used to assess your application.  Why Consumer Healthcare?  Right now, we’re on an incredible journey as we prepare to become the first independent, 100% focused consumer healthcare company. We’re doing this at a time when the work we do has never mattered more. Better everyday health is about improving the health and wellness of the consumers that we touch every year – over a billion and a half of them – and it goes beyond products. It’s about truly helping people manage their health proactively in different ways as consumer needs evolve.  With category leading brands such as Sensodyne, Voltaren and Centrum, built on trusted science and human understanding, and combined with our passion, knowledge and expertise, we’re uniquely placed to do this and to grow a strong, successful business.  This is an exciting time to join us and help shape the future. It’s an opportunity to be part of something special.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  In Consumer Healthcare we embrace our diverse workforce by creating an inclusive environment that celebrates our unique perspectives, generates curiosity to create unmatched understanding of each other, and promotes fair and equitable outcomes for everyone.  We’re striving to create a climate where we celebrate our diversity in all forms by treating each other with respect, listening to different viewpoints, supporting our communities, and creating a workplace where your authentic self belongs and thrives  Location  Recently we’ve shared some exciting proposals with our colleagues which mark an important moment in our preparations for separation and becoming a new, standalone Consumer Healthcare company.  Our preparations are going well. GSK is on track to separate in mid-2022 and create two incredible new companies, each with the ability to improve the health of millions of patients and consumers worldwide, and both great places to work.  We’ve already confirmed that our new Consumer Healthcare company will be headquartered in the UK and the first step we’re taking is to announce proposals to move our CH business from our current location in GSK House in Brentford when we separate, into a new, CH headquarters in Weybridge. This will be a temporary, but important move in the short term, whilst we take this opportunity to design for the future and create an inspiring, flexible, collaborative workspace that meets the changing needs of our people and our business needs.  Inspired by our new culture and purpose, and with a commitment to our sustainability goals, we plan to build a new campus close by which would be home to our headquarters teams, our UK business, our global Oral Health category, R&D and innovation teams, as well as a state-of-the-art Shopper Science lab.  The current and future success of the New GSK and New CH business is due in large part to the talent that resides in each organization. To ensure stability in the lead up to Separation, individuals who are currently dedicated to either business (New GSK or New CH) will not be able to apply for roles in the other business (including employees in the Global Support Functions and the Corporate Functions) prior to Separation, unless where their role has been placed at risk of redundancy. An exception process is in place, however cases in which exceptions would be made are expected to be rare (e.g. where a new role represents a significant promotion opportunity). You must therefore discuss this with your line manager before submitting an application.  #TechConsumer  As a company driven by our values of Patient focus, Transparency, Respect and Integrity, we know inclusion and diversity are essential for us to be able to succeed. We want all our colleagues to thrive at GSK bringing their unique experiences, ensuring they feel good and to keep growing their careers. As a candidate for a role, we want you to feel the same way.  As an Equal Opportunity Employer, we are open to all talent. In the US, we also adhere to Affirmative Action principles.

We’re building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we’re looking for brilliant builders who want to help define a low carbon future.  Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.  You can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process.  Working at CarbonChain  To join CarbonChain, you’ll be a keen team player who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we’ve run Amazon’s European supply chain, built JustEat’s corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We’ve got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there’s a lot we don’t know, and we’re hoping you can help fill that gap.  We encourage every member of our team to be the best they can be, whether that’s developing skills through their learning budget or participating in reading groups. Our work requires everybody to straddle the physical and digital worlds, and a growth mindset is essential.  What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?  As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there’s a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding, and get insights to clients.  As the first Data Science hire in the NYC office, you’ll help form the team in NYC and collaborate closely with London. Your work will directly contribute to the acquisition and success of North American clients, whilst helping to shape the product to meet the needs of a new market.  This is a role that will involve lots of contact with clients and close collaboration with the sales team. We’re looking for a commercially-minded data scientist who is curious about discovering and solving customer problems.  You Can Expect To Have Ownership of your projects Extensive client exposure The ability to make real changes with tangible business value Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We’ve got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.  Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology and the ability to build close relationships with your team.  Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with? Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond Machine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch Data visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and Altair Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will. Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase. PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you’ll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds. Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond). Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions. Quality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team. Agile development, using various approaches from Scrum toElephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements. GitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality. Continuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most. Teamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business. You don’t need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we’d love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.  What We Require From Applicants Right to work in the US and willingness to come to the NYC office 2+ days a week 2+ years of relevant work experience A passion for environmental issues A demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with engineers The grit and energy to work in an early stage startup What We're Offering Healthcare Competitive salary + generous equity package Flexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing $2,000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things Tech equipment of your choice Regular social activities Generous amount of holidays, 26 days of annual leave We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.

Our teams are fascinated by human behaviour, and particularly how this impacts their online activity. We utilise whatever data we can get our hands on to drive the content that we produce, creating smart strategies, and more meaningful experiences. We’re looking for a newbie to join our award winning Data Science team at an entry level position - ideal for someone wanting to take the first steps on their data science career journey! In a little more detail: As a member of SHARE’s Data Science team, you will utilise a strong analytical mindset and solid programming skills to provide insight to our internal strategy and creative teams and directly to our wide range of clients. The Junior Data Scientist will be required to implement our own intelligence suite of deep learning, NLP, and forecasting tools and analyse and communicate the resulting insights in a way that addresses our clients’ challenges, and ultimately, their success. Recently, we’ve been focussing on the NLP side of things as our clients have huge databases of high quality social media, survey and review documents that we’ve been applying linguistic and psychological theory to squeeze business impact from. You will be involved across the entire data science workflow - from finding and importing datasets, cleaning and tidying the data, data transformation and feature engineering and of course, modelling and visualisation.  We programme mainly in R (with some other languages thrown in), so the role is ideal for a recent graduate seeking to get into data science or an analyst with some knowledge of R striving to develop their data science skills. The role will require a mix of skills, with some computer science knowledge for the development of function writing and package deployment in the machine learning and NLP workspace, but also social science and research skills to present results in a way that answer business and research questions.

We get it, this isn’t a job post that’s asking for 8 years hands-on python for an entry level position. We want to provide you with the foundation to develop, all we ask is you show the desire to keep learning. Bonus points: Previous work or experience with Natural Language Processing techniques Some experience with web data services like APIs Hatred of SPSS. Our Data Director built the core of our R Package Suite because he despised using SPSS for statistics at university. If you share that pain you’ll fit right in. Previous use of major social analytics tools (Sprinklr, Facebook, Twitter, social listening, etc.) Knowledge of wider programming languages such as Python, JavaScript and C# Knowledge of cloud computing services such as Azure or AWS.

Will it be you?   WHO WE ARE  Artefact is a new-generation AI consulting company. For an early-career professional like you, we are the best school to learn about data science and ML in an applied business context: We are growing quickly... We have been growing enormously fast over the past few years, and want to grow by an additional factor of 4 over the next 4 years. If you join us, you will be an early member of an expanding team. … while already having a global scale. We are about 1,200 now, with a tech team of over 300, scattered across 20 offices on every continent. We have a proven track record of making people grow fast. Artefact alumni have created startups, led technical teams at companies big and small, been hired by Google and Amazon, etc.    WHAT YOU WILL DO  As a junior data scientist:  You will help develop DS/ML models. In most of our missions, we create, develop, or maintain data science or machine learning models. These can include: sales prediction models, CV product recognition models, production optimization, etc. You will gain a wide range of data science experience. You will be expected to work on a few missions a year (1-3), which will expose you to different industries, use cases, and technologies. You will see the real-world impact of your work. Unlike other companies that specialize in fancy vaporware, we specialize in building solutions that can be used for years and actually make a difference for our clients. This also means that you will get experience interacting with clients and non-technical people. You will work with cutting-edge tools. Our stack varies from client to client, but is generally very modern — for example: GCP with Terraform, DBT, GitHub Actions, Palantir Foundry. You could also develop state-of-the-art research. In some specialized areas (such as marketing measurement), Artefact is a world leader developing industry-leading practices, and we're still building heavily in these areas.   MUST-HAVE REQUIREMENTS  We will primarily judge your application on the following criteria:  You are fluent in one programming language (preferably Python, but it can be R, Julia, Scala, etc.). You have significant knowledge in data processing, data modeling, algorithms, and data architecture. That's the equivalent of a master’s in Data Science, but we're flexible. You have excellent problem-solving skills when it comes to data, and you can learn fast. You are able to talk about your work to non-technical people, in English.  We strongly prefer if you're a German resident, although we'll consider great candidates within the EU.   NICE-TO-HAVE REQUIREMENTS  We're not expecting anyone to meet all of these requirements, but you should at least meet a couple of these:  You know your way around SQL, and you've performed complex data manipulations before. You have experience applying data science and AI in the real world, in production systems or with client data. You've built forecasting and predictive models, especially with tabular data. You have experience with clustering algorithms. You've done some NLP projects. You do data science outside of notebooks. You are familiar with MLOps practices. You have significant software engineering skills to complement your data science chops. You have good visualization skills (dashboards, SHAP...).   OUR CULTURE  We are a consulting company, which is great if you want to get more exposure to business and work alongside people with very diverse skill sets. Our team is remote-first, and we don't care where you work. We would like to see you in Hamburg a few times a year, though. (Don’t hesitate to ask us about our remote policy during the interview process.) We are uncompromising on work-life balance (in a good way). Nobody at Artefact is expected to be on-call at night.   OUR BENEFITS  Very competitive compensation package, with twice-a-year bonuses. Flexible equipment options. Home office equipment (such as an external monitor) if required. 6 weeks PTO + 4 weeks of “workation” per year. Financial support for training and studies. Subsidies for mental health apps and bike leasing. Corporate pension plan. We have an excellent espresso machine in Hamburg, fwiw.  This list is specific to Germany, and might change slightly otherwise.    If you have any questions, feel free to message us at leopold.mebazaa+jobs@artefact.com or michael.voelske+jobs@artefact.com.  We encourage candidates from all backgrounds and are welcoming you regardless of gender, race, or LGBT+ background.",Niemcy,,Hamburg
